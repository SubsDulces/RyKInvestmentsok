This file represents a social preview image that would be created with the following properties:

- Dimensions: 1200x630 pixels
- Background: Colombian flag colors (blue, red, yellow)
- Text: "RYK INVESTMENTS" in white
- Tagline: "Aut√©nticos Sabores de Colombia"

Since the canvas package is having installation issues in this environment,
this placeholder file is created instead.

The actual image would be generated with proper colors and text positioning.
